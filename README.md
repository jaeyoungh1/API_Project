# :crown: HeirBnB 

HeirBnB is a website clone inspired by AirBnb, an online marketplace for homestays and vacation rentals. The platform connects people who want to rent out lodging to those who are looking for acommodation in specific locales. This clone name is inspired by a throw-away line from the American television show, "The Good Place": 
> "I used HeirBnB. "H-E-I-R." It's an app for heirs and heiresses where we swap mansions, private islands... blimp hangars, that sort of thing."
